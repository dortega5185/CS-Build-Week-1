            <p>
              Conway's game of life was invented by Cambridge mathematician John
              Conway in 1970.

            <p>
              Its rules are applied to create what we call a cellular Automaton,
              a fancy word for a grid of cells that cycle through different
              states over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              It involves four simple rules which result in wildy differing
              sequences. An initial group of live cells can create an
              unpredictable chaotic sequence, sometimes it will create a
              repeating sequence.
